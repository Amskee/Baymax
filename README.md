# Baymax - AI chat bot for Personal Health Care

Baymax is a web app, it is developed to book doctor appointments through a chat bot. The chat bot predicts the user's input through an AI algorithm we've been developing. It makes proceedings accordingly. This enables the patient to book his/her appointment from their home. The patient receives a notification whether the respective doctor has confirmed or postponed their appointment request. This way we hope to reduce the wait time at hospitals. :)

# Installation

* Copy Baymax folder to your server (say localhost).
* Open Baymax folder in your browser (say http://localhost/baymax/).
* Do nothing.
* It automatically installs and redirects you to home page of the app.
